# Documentation Index

## Current (Keep)

- `Deployment-Guide.md`: end-to-end deployment (Docker and local run)
- `Configuration-Reference.md`: `.env` and `settings.yaml` override reference
- `Implementation-Checklist.md`: implementation status and progress tracking
- `Codebase-Ingestion-Guide.md`: ingestion workflow and usage details
- `Skills/Skill-Template.md`: MCP/Claude skill template (sanitized)

## Notes

- Root quick-start is in `README.md`.
- Korean root guide is in `README.ko.md`.
- Archive documents were removed to keep deployment docs minimal.
